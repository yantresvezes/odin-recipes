        <p><b>This Brazilian chicken stroganoff recipe is our go-to stroganoff for our weekly rotation because</b> (hello!!) chicken is cheaper. Plus, this chicken stroganoff recipe is slightly easier to make than <b>Brazilian beef stroganoff</b>. We save that one to make occasionally on weekends, or as a family meal—it’s more of a special treat.</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Prep.</b> For this recipe, I like to dice the onion more on the small size. As for the chicken, you want to make sure you cut it into cubes that are roughly the same size. Then, just season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Aaand that is pretty much all the prep you need to do.</li><br>
        
        <li><b>Saute.</b> Place a large heavy-bottom pan or Dutch oven over medium to high heat. Add the butter, and let it melt. Then, you’ll want to cook the chicken until the pieces begin to brown.</li><br>
        
        <li>Add the onion and cook it until it’s transparent. Then, add the garlic and cook until fragrant.</li><br>
        
        <li>Make the chicken stroganoff sauce. Add the tomato sauce and the ketchup to the pan, and let them come to a simmer.</li><br>
        
        <li>Finish with cream. Pour in the cream, stir, and let it simmer uncovered for 5 minutes… then sprinkle in some parsley to finish it off! :)</li><br>
